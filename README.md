# Smart-Food-App
In modern travel and urban environments, users face difficulty in choosing suitable food outlets due to information overload and unreliable reviews. Existing platforms provide ratings but lack contextual and group-based decision support.
This project aims to develop a smart web application that assists users in selecting optimal food places based on location, preferences, crowd level, and AI-based review analysis.
